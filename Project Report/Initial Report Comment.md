The report is nearly finished, with the exception of the remainder of the optimization section, the conclusion, and some images of the results. I will get the images for the report next time I am in the lab to finalize the first portion of the report. I am still in the midst of optimization as I only recently got the entirety of my design functioning. My plan for the remainder of the project is to focus on optimization and trying different directives or loop methods. Additionally, I have the presentation to begin preparing for and the remainder of the report to finish.
