# RSA-Project
RSA Algorithm implementation for EECE4632.

**FOR PROJECT UPDATES, GO TO "NOTES AND UPDATES" FOLDER**

## Overview:
My project for EECE4632 is implementing an RSA encryption algorithm on the Zynq board. The final result will feed values into an Overlay that computes the decryption and encryption of data on the FPGA. 


## Repository info:

There are currently 4 main folders:
 - Note and Updates: stores update reports and ongoing notes document.
 - HLS Source Code: the cpp files used in HLS and any .tcl, .hwh, or .bit files used for the overlay.
 - Jupyter Notebooks: all the notebooks where the algorithm is tested on the Zynq board.
 - Python Code: brainstorms/rough drafts of the notebooks in the Jupyter folder developed offline (w/o Zynq).
